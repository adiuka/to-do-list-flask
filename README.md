# to-do-list-flask

A very simple to do list for a busy programmer. Has an integrated date picker when making a new task and will sort out all of the tasks based on urgency of time (date).
Can also view the task for more information, meaning to see a description etc. In this window, you can mark or unmark complete, edit, and ofc delete.
The rest is quite self explanatory. 

Project part of assignment. But future imporovements will look at:
1. Creating users, meaning that different users upon log in could have different tasks.
2. Adding cross user functionality somehow. Have not worked with this, but would be nice to connect tasks within a group or company somehow.
3. Adding a timer at the top, to count how long you have been working, and send hints to maybe take a break. I know I need one of those at least.
4. Adding more limitations to the task form, meaning reducing the title lenght, Author etc. Now could be easily broken
5. Creating scripting that could format tasks better if there are a lot of them, meaning adding a drop down button for loading more tasks.
6. In general the app looks more like a phone app, but could be nice to make it more impressive for desktops.

Otherwise enjoy, hope you find it useful.
